# PP2_FinalProject
One of my 3 different versions of the final project for PP2. One of these is the final version and I'm not sure which. We were to make a program that is just a game of checkers, with key features being highlighted pieces and moves and dynamic scaling (you can make the window bigger or smaller and everything stays in place).

Made in Eclipse/Java, src will be the raw code, bin is compiled.
